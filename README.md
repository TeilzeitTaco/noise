# TVnoise
TV static generator written in FreeBasic!

### Description:
TVnoise will let you experience *epic* TV static on your PC, just like you remember it on your old CRT!

### How to build:
* Change line 3 in "/Src/litenoise2.rc" to point to "/Src/Res/retro.ico".
* Compile as GUI or console using FBedit or type "fbc litenoise2.bas litenoise2.rc".
* Closing the program could be tricky if compiled as GUI, so console mode is recommended.

### Thanks:
